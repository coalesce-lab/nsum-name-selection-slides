**Abstract:** To estimate the distribution of the number of acquaintances of the members of a society, the Network Scale-Up Method asks survey respondents about the number of people they know with a set of features, preferably first names, for which national statistics are available. For this method to be precise, a set of names needs to be selected for the survey that jointly represents the population on a smaller scale in relevant traits such as gender or age. Finding the optimal set of names is a combinatorial problem for which this paper provides a solution approach. The approach can be applied to any population for which name statistics distributed over categories are available. We empirically show that our approach successfully provides subsets of names replicating the population distribution for six countries with very different name statistics.
