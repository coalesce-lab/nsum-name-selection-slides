  abstract = {Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a popular method for surveying hard-to-reach populations, especially in the public health domain. Adjusting for the complex sampling mechanism of the RDS procedure is challenging. We propose a new model for the RDS mechanism motivated by a graph model, which we call the Homophily Configuration Graph. Under this model, we develop a new estimator for population proportions that is robust to seed bias, differential activity, differential recruitment and short recruitment chains. We also connect it to existing RDS theory by showing that, if the sample fraction is small, our estimator limits to the popular Salganik-Heckathorn estimator. We perform simulation studies on both empirically observed networks and networks with known statistical properties, suggesting that this new estimator has less bias than currently recommended estimators.},

  abstract = {The authors have developed and tested scale-up methods, based on a simple social network theory, to estimate the size of hard-to-count subpopulations. The authors asked a nationally representative sample of respondents how many people they knew in a list of 32 subpopulations, including 29 subpopulations of known size and 3 of unknown size. Using these responses, the authors produced an effectively unbiased maximum likelihood estimate of the number of people each respondent knows. These estimates were then used to back-estimate the size of the three populations of unknown size. Maximum likelihood values and 95\% confidence intervals are found for seroprevalence, 800,000 ¬±43,000; for homeless, 526,000 ¬±35,000; and for women raped in the last 12 months, 194,000¬±21,000. The estimate for seroprevalence agrees strikingly with medical estimates, the homeless estimate is well within the published estimates, and the authors' estimate lies in the middle of the published range for rape victims.},

  abstract = {Results from a representative survey of respondents in Florida are given, concerning their knowledge about members of their personal network, and specifically how many people respondents know in selected subpopulations. We employ a method known as a ‚Äúnetwork scale-up method‚Äù. By using a collection of subpopulations of known size, and also asking about one subpopulation (those who are seropositive) of unknown size, we make various estimates of personal network size and the size of the seropositive subpopulation. Our best (maximum likelihood, unbiased) estimates are 108 members of the network defined by ‚Äúhaving been in contact with during the previous two years‚Äù, and (approximately unbiased) 1.6 million for the seropositive subpopulation. Because of the proportional over-representation of AIDS (and presumably, therefore, seropositive) in Florida, by a factor of about two, this latter estimate could be an overestimate.},

We show that, without adjustment, ERGMs preserve density as network size increases. Density invariance is often not appropriate for social networks. We suggest a simple modification based on an offset which instead preserves the mean degree and accommodates changes in network composition asymptotically. We demonstrate that this approach allows ERGMs to be applied to the important situation of egocentrically sampled data. We analyze data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS).},

  abstract = {Egocentric network sampling observes the network of interest from the point of view of a set of sampled actors, who provide information about themselves and anonymized information on their network neighbors. In survey research, this is often the most practical, and sometimes the only, way to observe certain classes of networks, with the sexual networks that underlie HIV transmission being the archetypal case. Although methods exist for recovering some descriptive network features, there is no rigorous and practical statistical foundation for estimation and inference for network models from such data. We identify a subclass of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) amenable to being estimated from egocentrically sampled network data, and apply pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimation to do so and to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of the estimates. For ERGMs parametrized to be invariant to network size, we describe a computationally tractable approach to this problem. We use this methodology to help understand persistent racial disparities in HIV prevalence in the US. We also discuss some extensions, including how our framework may be applied to triadic effects when data about ties among the respondent‚Äôs neighbors are also collected.},

  abstract = {"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a class of statistical models for social networks. They account for the presence (and absence) of network ties and so provide a model for network structure. An ERGM models a given network in terms of small local tie-based structures, such as reciprocated ties and triangles. A social network can be thought of as being built up of these local patterns of ties, called network configurations xe "network configurations" , which correspond to the parameters in the model. Moreover, these configurations can be considered to arise from local social processes, whereby actors in the network form connections in response to other ties in their social environment. ERGMs are a principled statistical approach to modeling social networks. They are theory-driven in that their use requires the researcher to consider the complex, intersecting and indeed potentially competing theoretical reasons why the social ties in the observed network have arisen. For instance, does a given network structure occur due to processes of homophily xe "actor-relation effects:homophily" , xe "homophily" \textbackslash t "see actor-relation effects" reciprocity xe "reciprocity" , transitivity xe "transitivity" , or indeed a combination of these? By including such parameters together in the one model a researcher can test these effects one against the other, and so infer the social processes that have built the network. Being a statistical model, an ERGM permits inferences about whether, in our network of interest, there are significantly more (or fewer) reciprocated ties, or triangles (for instance), than we would expect"--},
